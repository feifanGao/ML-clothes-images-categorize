# ML-clothes-images-categorize
The goal of this assignment is to build a classifier to classify some grayscale images of the size 28x28 into a set of categories. The dimension of the original data is large, so you need to be smart on which method you gonna use and perhaps perform a pre-processing step to reduce the amount of computation. Part of your marks will be a function of the performance of your classifier on the test set.<br />

The dataset consists of a training set of 30,000 examples and a test set of 5,000 examples. They belong to 10 different categories. The validation set is not provided, but you can randomly pick a subset of the training set for validation. The labels of the first 2,000 test examples are given, you will analyse the performance of your proposed method by exploiting the 2,000 test examples. It is NOT allowed to use any examples from the test set for training; or it will be considered as cheating. The rest 3,000 labels of the test set are reserved for marking purpose.<br />

There are 10 classes in total:<br />
0 T-shirt/Top<br />
1 Trouser<br />
2 Pullover<br />
3 Dress<br />
4 Coat<br />
5 Sandal<br />
